# DSA_notes
I created this repository to maintain a collection of helpful concepts/tricks, that might be useful in solving DSA questions. <br>
The repository curently has a markdown file which has my notes in the form of points. I will be constantly adding new points to that list and also in future I am thinking of adding resources
and other usefull stuff to this repository. <br>

If you find this repo useful then feel free to star it. You can also contribute to the repo by forking it and adding new points that you feel would be useful for everyone. You can also contribute 
by improving the overall look and feel of the md file so that it looks good and is also readable at the same time.
